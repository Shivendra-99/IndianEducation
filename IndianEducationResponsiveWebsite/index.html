                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The History of education in India is believed to have begun in the
                    Vedic times, with the teaching of traditional elements like teaching the Vedas,
                    religion, arithmetic, and logic in small groups. The students would go to a guru, who was generally
                    an old man or woman who resided within a clearing in a forest or on the outskirts of the same. To
                    gain admission in the class conducted by the guru, every student would have to pass a litmus test
                    set by them, and if they passed, they would be allowed to attend. This type of education was called
                    the Gurukul System.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Importance of learning coding for young learners. Coding is arguably
                    one of the most important skills for current as well as future generations to learn. For young
                    learners, programming helps to gain problem-solving skills
                    Both parents and educators believe that in a country like India, where the education system grapples
                    with lack of innovation, infrastructure, and archaic curriculum, coding is a well-structured way to
                    introduce children to logical thinking and problem-solving. This also prepares them for a job market
                    dominated by data science and computer science.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                    legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976
                    made education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared
                    formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India,
                    now with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between
                    states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.
